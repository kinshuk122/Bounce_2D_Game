# About

# Description
In "Bounce Odyssey," players control a ball that always bounces and must navigate it through a series of challenging obstacles. As they progress through the game, players will encounter obstacles such as gaps, spikes, and moving objects that they must avoid in order to keep the ball rolling. Additionally, players can use trampolines to give the ball an extra boost and make it bounce even higher.

# Game Development
I developed this game using Unity and C#. I have used Clip Studio to create models for my 2D game, which I have then imported into Unity to implement into the game. I programmed this game using C# to provide the structure and narrative for the game along with level designing. Moreover, I wrote the story of Bounce.
